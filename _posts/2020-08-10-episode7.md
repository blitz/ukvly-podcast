## Show Notes and Links

Flo and Julian managed to get [Marius Melzer](https://deepspec.org/)
into the recording studio and talk with him about his passion: Formal
Verification. In this episode, we make a broader sweep compared to our
earlier spotlight on [Ada/SPARK]({% post_url 2019-12-20-episode1 %})
and touch on many projects that are on-going in the formal
verification community.

We discuss how to get going with formal verification and also touch on
the theoretical underpinnings.

We forgot to mention it in the episode, but please also check out
Marius' other project: [palava.tv](https://palava.tv/)!
