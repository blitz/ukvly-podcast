[Michael
Roitzsch](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/professur-fuer-betriebssysteme/die-professur)
returns to Syslog and we talk about scheduling in operating
systems. Michael has focussed his research on soft real-time systems
and explored, among other things, how good scheduling can help with
smooth video display. In this episode, we introduce basic scheduling
concepts, what is happening in scheduling today and how the
increasingly multi-core world will shape schedulers in the future.

Michael is the acting head of the TU Dresden Operating Systems group
and researcher at the [Barkhausen
Institute](https://www.barkhauseninstitut.org/en).
