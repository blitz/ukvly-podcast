## Show Notes and Links

Flo and Julian invited [Jo Van
Bulck](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/jo) to the Syslog
Podcast. Jo is probably best known for discovering the
[Foreshadow](https://foreshadowattack.eu/) vulnerability in Intel
CPUs, but his research is into the broader security of Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs). In this episode, we've picked the most
high-profile TEE technology: Jo guides us through the confusing and
impressive thing that is the Intel Software Guard Extensions.
