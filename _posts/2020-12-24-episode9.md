## Show Notes and Links

Werner Haas, resident hardware expert and colleague at [Cyberus
Technology](https://www.cyberus-technology.de/blog.html), joins Flo
and Julian to talk about the state of processor hardware in 2020.

We discuss instruction set archicture (ISA) in the context of the x86
vs. ARM vs. RISC-V debate and why CPU ISA might not be that important
for performance and battery life after all.
