## Show Notes and Links

Flo and Julian talk with Michael Hohmuth, who is the head and
co-founder of [Kernkonzept](https://www.kernkonzept.com/). Michael was
already interested in operating systems before he joined the [OS group
at TU Dresden](https://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/). He started to write the
first [L4 variant in a high-level
language](http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/) when the state of the
art was to write them in assembly.

Many years later, Michael together with other long-time L4 developers
continue their passion at Kernkonzept. We talk with Michael about how
L4 began and evolved in Dresden, how work continues at Kernkonzept and
how L4 eventually powered a smart oven (among other things, of
course).
