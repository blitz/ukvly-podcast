## Show Notes and Links

Flo and Julian talk to Alexander Senier about
[Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)),
[SPARK](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark) and how to build reliable
and trustworthy software. We also talk about Alexander's company,
[Componolit](https://componolit.com/).
