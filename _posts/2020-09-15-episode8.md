## Show Notes and Links

In this episode, we talk with [Martin Decky](https://twitter.com/mdecky)
about [HelenOS](http://www.helenos.org/). HelenOS is a modular
multiserver operating system based on a custom microkernel. It has
been implemented by a group of people at the [Charles
University](https://cuni.cz/) in Prague and is unusual for being a
non-commercial operating system project with such a long history. It
is fair to say that Martin has shaped HelenOS and HelenOS has shaped
Martin for almost the last two decades.

Join us while we cover the beginnings of HelenOS, its design
philosophy and its struggles over its long lifetime.
